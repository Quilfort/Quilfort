### Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Quilfort! I'm currently working as a backend developer, but my journey with code started way back when I first picked up C. Since then, I've explored various projects â€”big and smallâ€” and have grown passionate about creating fun, quirky things along the way. 

I studied at [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/en/)/[42 Network](https://www.42network.org/) in Amsterdam, and I still keep those roots close as I continue learning and growing in tech.

You'll find me working on backend development, dabbling with AI, or diving into some gaming-inspired side projects. I like to keep things fun, so feel free to explore what I've been up to here!

More updates to come soonâ€”this README is always a work in progress.
